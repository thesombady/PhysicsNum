# PhysicsNum
 Physics Numerical methods applied and used during the bachlelor degree in Physics at Lund University. Most notbly is the numerical approximation methods and similar.
 The code regression works upon least square methods, and weighted least square methods and have been verified. If an issue occurs when using this package, contact via GitHub for a fast solution.

# Code
```python
xlist1 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
ylist1 = np.array([4,6,9,10,12,14,16,18,20,21])
Model = ForceLinearreg(xlist1, ylist1)
print(Model)
plt.plot(xlist1, ylist1, '.', label = "DATA")
plt.plot(xlist1, xlist1 * Model[0], '-', label = "Regression")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
This is a small indication of PhysicsNum.ForceLinearreg, where PhysicsNum.Linearreg is written in the same way.
